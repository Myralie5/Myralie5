- Hi, I’m Myr
- I’m interested in video games
- I’m currently learning Python
- please don't try to contact me without my permission
- Pronouns: she/her
- sometimes I wonder if I'm depressed but probably not
- and then I start thinking about dying
- and then I stay awake for three hours thinking 'what happens when you die'
- thanks a lot, brain
- currently alternating between AP3, a private project, learning Python and Minecraft, so I'm really bad at getting things done.
- AP3 refuses to work so I've been tossing it around a lot
- I am also now working with the wonderful Veenom on a private project!!! Entirely because I cannot draw!!! But they're still awesome!!!
